# Text corpus annotated for question-under-discussion (QUD)
Corpus of driving reports from German motoring magazines. Texts' discourse structure was annotated using QUD trees, where the level of conceptual abstraction increases with hight in the trees. See annotation_guidelines.pdf for details on the tagging and QUD tree structures. Files are in XML format with the tags described in annotation_guidelines.pdf. See Hesse_LDK_talk.mp4 and Hesse_LDK_talk.pdf for further details.
